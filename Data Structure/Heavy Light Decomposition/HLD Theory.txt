1. HLD split the tree into several path(vertex-disjoint chains-Meaning no two chain has a node in common)
2. For any node v, it can reach root by traversing at most logn path(logn chain)


Terminology related to HLD:
1. Heavy Edge: IF subtreesizeof(child) >= subtreesizeof(parent)/2, then (u,v) is a heavy edge. Parent node can have at most one heavy edge.
2. Light Edge: All the other edges are light edge.

Information you must store:
Given a node, to which chain does that node belong to
Given a node, what is the position of that node in its chain
Given a node, what is the head of the chain
Given a node, what is the length of the chain

HLD Modified:
  1. Special child: Among all child nodes of a node, the one with maximum subtree size is special.
  2. Special edge:  The edge connecting with its special child is considered as special edge.
  
  In this version of HLD:
  1. Perform Euler Tour in Tree(ETT)
  2. In DFS always move to special child first
